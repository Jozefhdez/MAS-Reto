## Formal Proposal  
We will develop a **drone agent** in Unity, with a 3D park environment modeled in Blender.  

- **Objective**: The drone must land within 2 meters of a person wearing an orange vest and helmet.  
- **Agents**:  
  - Drone Agent: autonomous decision-making, perception, actions.  
  - Ground Control Agent: supervises or overrides the drone.  
  - Person of Interest: target identified by vest and helmet.  
  - Other People: distractors.
